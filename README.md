# RealEstateInvestorMetric
This is a repo, I am creating to work on insightful and innovative investor metrics for Australian Real Estate

The metric I am trying to build and work on here is a "Happiness" score.

The Suburb Happiness and Community Wellbeing Score is a new metric which can help Australian residential property investors understand how enjoyable, supportive, and community-oriented a suburb feels. It combines practical indicators such as safety, parks and green space, walkability, school quality, and community participation into a single, easy-to-read score out of 100. This makes it simple for investors to quickly assess whether an area is the kind of place people actually enjoy living in.

This metric is especially relevant today because the new generation of homeowners and renters values lifestyle and community in a way that previous generations simply did not prioritise. Younger buyers, including Gen Z and younger Millennials, are more focused on wellbeing, outdoor spaces, social connection, and balanced living. They are willing to move slightly further away from traditional “hotspots” if the suburb offers better quality of life, greenery, safer streets, good childcare, or a sense of community identity. These preferences are now shaping the residential market, and investors need metrics that reflect what modern families and young professionals truly care about.

A higher wellbeing score often signals suburbs with strong long-term potential. These areas experience consistent demand, lower vacancy, and greater resilience during market downturns because the people living there feel secure, supported, and connected to their neighbourhood. Investors looking for moderately priced areas with solid future growth can use this metric to identify suburbs that align with the new generation’s lifestyle expectations well before prices surge.

The score is built from everyday indicators that make sense to non-technical investors. Safety, school performance, walkable access to shops and cafés, green space, community events, sporting clubs, and government investment all contribute to the final number. Instead of analysing multiple datasets, investors can rely on one straightforward measure that reflects both the physical and social strengths of a suburb.

What makes this metric innovative in Australia is that most property tools still focus heavily on yield, past performance, or demographic numbers. While these remain important, they do not capture the lived experience of residents. The Suburb Happiness and Community Wellbeing Score fills this gap by highlighting suburbs where the new generation actually wants to live. It translates shifting social values into a practical, investor-friendly insight.

Overall, this metric helps Australian residential property investors make decisions that stay aligned with the expectations of modern buyers. As lifestyle, mental wellbeing, and community connection become key drivers of demand, this measurement offers a clear advantage. It reflects how people live and what the next generation values, making it a meaningful tool for identifying suburbs with strong long-term appeal.
